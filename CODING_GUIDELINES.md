#### 1. File and Folder Structure

- Keep a clean and organized project structure as outlined in your project's README.
- Follow a consistent naming pattern for files and directories.

#### 2. Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and components.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction`).
- Use PascalCase for class and component names (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyComponent`).
- Use UPPERCASE for constants (e.g., `API_KEY`, `MAX_ATTEMPTS`).

#### 3. Code Formatting

- Use a consistent code formatting style (e.g., Prettier, ESLint) and configure it in your project.
- Indentation should be two or four spaces. Be consistent throughout your project.

#### 4. Comments

- Write clear and concise comments for complex code sections, including explanations of intent, algorithm explanations, and known issues.
- Avoid unnecessary or redundant comments that merely restate the code.

```javascript
// Good: Explaining the purpose
const result = calculateTotal(); // Calculates the total amount

// Bad: Redundant comment
const result = calculateTotal(); // Calculate the total amount using a function
```

#### 5. Variables and Constants

- Declare variables at the beginning of functions or code blocks when possible.
- Limit variable scope. Use `const` for values that do not change and `let` for variables that change.
- Avoid using global variables whenever possible.

```javascript
// Good: Scoped variable
function myFunction() {
  const result = performCalculation();
  console.log(result);
}
```

#### 6. Functions and Methods

- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
- Use descriptive function names that reflect their purpose.
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to eliminate duplicated code.

```javascript
// Good: Descriptive function name
function calculateTotalPrice(items) {
  // ...
}
```

#### 7. Classes and Components

- Use classes and components to encapsulate functionality and maintain a clean structure.
- Follow component-based development principles for front-end components.
- Ensure that components are reusable, stateless, and focused on rendering.

#### 8. Error Handling

- Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors.
- Provide meaningful error messages, and consider logging errors for debugging.
- Utilize error-handling middleware in the back-end.

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

#### 9. Imports and Exports

- Organize imports at the top of files.
- Use destructuring for named imports.
- Avoid wildcard imports to maintain clear dependencies.

```javascript
// Good: Named imports and destructuring
import { Component, useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

#### 10. Testing

- Write unit tests for important functions and components.
- Use testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library for front-end tests.
- Keep your tests separate from your source code.

#### 11. Security

- Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- Protect sensitive data, such as API keys and secrets, using environment variables.
- Use secure authentication and authorization methods.

```javascript
// Good: Using environment variables for secrets
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

These coding guidelines are a starting point for maintaining a consistent and high-quality codebase for your Envision project. Adapt and expand these guidelines as your project evolves, and ensure that your team follows them consistently to achieve maintainable and secure code.
